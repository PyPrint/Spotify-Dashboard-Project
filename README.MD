This interactive Spotify Music Knowledge Dashboard is the first portfolio project in a series of several deliverables. This dashboard can be used at the website: https://

To use this dashboard, first run the 'Data.py' file in the data folder. This will give you four csv files. 

Secondly, you can run all cells in the 'Main.ipynb' (if you have the installed libraries). 

To run the actual dashboard locally, you run the file 'App.py'. 


Have fun! Jurriaan.
